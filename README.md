# Clone Distribution Chart

> This script will generate a clone distribution chart for any dataset made with ImmuneDB.

> The initial goal for anyone just getting their hands on repertoire data is to understand the dataset. This script will generate a graph that gives an overview of how many clones there are per subject, and how those clones are divided among metadata.

> This script requires python >= 3.5, as well as the other requirements in the requirements.txt.

> Example charts are given below.
